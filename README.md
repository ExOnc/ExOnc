- 👋 Hi, I’m @ExOnc
- 👀 I’m interested in submitting more physical activity/exercise measures and observations to LOINC for coding and use in wearables, apps, EHRs, and research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that there are not enough of these measures in LOINC and that few physical activity/exercise researchers know of UCUM or LOINC.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on LOINC/UCUM coding for cardiopulmonary exercise testing measures, physical actitivty questionnaires, and governmental physical activity guidelines.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe I submitted the first medical emoji, LOINC code 89843-7 for Fitzpatrick skin type classification (can adjust photoplethysmography heart rate monitors), also tied to Unicode.
